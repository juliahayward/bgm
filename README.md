Many years ago I had an account on *Phoenix*, the university IBM mainframe, and it had a simple backgammon program which I used to play against - and win rather a lot. When Phoenix came to the end of its life I rescued the BCPL source code, rewrote it more or less verbatim in C, and nearly got it working - then forgot about it for another 25+ years. In 2020 I stumbled across that C source file and decided to rewrite it again, this time in C#, and pit it against eXtremeGammon. We shall see...
